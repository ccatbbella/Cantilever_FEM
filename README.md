# Cantilever_FEM
- This project uses MATLAB Partial Differential Equation Toolbox to perform structural analysis of a cantilever using Finite Element Methods (FEM).
- It is based on [this](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/finite-element-analysis-in-matlab-part-1-structural-analysis-using-finite-element-method-in-matlab-1600851689410.html) tutorial.
- The stl file is sourced from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) at [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17866/files).
